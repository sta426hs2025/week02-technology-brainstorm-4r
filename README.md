# Exercise 2a

Image-based spatial transcriptomics combines high-resolution microscopy with molecular profiling to map gene expression directly within intact tissue sections. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are captured in situ using fluorescent probes or barcoded oligonucleotides that bind to specific transcripts. Imaging technologies then record the spatial distribution of these fluorescent signals at subcellular resolution. Computational pipelines process the images, decode the barcodes, and reconstruct transcript maps, allowing researchers to see where each gene is expressed within the tissue architecture. This enables the study of cell–cell interactions, tissue organization, and disease mechanisms in their native context.

# Exercise 2b

Hi-C sequencing is a chromosome conformation capture technique that maps the three-dimensional organization of the genome. In this method, chromatin is crosslinked to preserve physical interactions between DNA regions. The DNA is then cut with restriction enzymes, and the ends are filled in with biotin-labeled nucleotides before being ligated together—joining DNA fragments that were spatially close in the nucleus. After crosslink reversal and sequencing, the paired reads indicate which genomic loci were in proximity. Computational analysis converts these contact frequencies into genome-wide interaction maps, revealing chromatin loops, topologically associating domains (TADs), and higher-order nuclear architecture.

We used ChatGPT and prompted "okay now do the same for "Hi-C-Seq".
